# ZEIC - Community Version

This STANDALONE Mod is the spiritual successor of ZEI and ZEI Continued.

The goal is to follow Sgt. J. Andrews / Samantha initial attempt maintain this highly useful mod.

**Contributions and Pull Requests are very welcome!**
More Details below

# ZEIC - Changes
- Create 3DEN Layer per Building for Interior Fill and Garrison.
- Improve Performance

# ZEI - Zeus and Eden Interiors
A tool to quickly decorate and populate interiors for your missions in either Zeus or Eden.

## ZEI Interior Modules
### Garrison Building
- Fills a building with your choice of faction and number (should support any units Addon).
- Attempts to find the best direction for the units to face.
- Avoids spawning pilots/crew etc.1

### Interior Fill
- Fills a building with either a military or civilian template.
- Choose either an area or single building and if the interior should be editable in Zeus.
- Supports CUP buildings.
- Pressing 'LookAround' (Default: ALT) will skip the GUI and immediately try and fill the nearest building with a military template.

### Object Fill
- Fills a table or shelf with objects.
- Choose how many objects to spawn on the table and if they should be editable in Zeus.
- Pressing 'LookAround' (Default: ALT) will skip the GUI and immediately try and fill an object a random selection of items.

### Object Switch
- Converts objects of one region to another region (e.g. Green Sandbags to Brown Sandbags)
- Supports CUP objects but positioning may be affected due to model sizes.

## ZEI Development Modules
The following modules are designed to make it easier for you to help with the development of this addon, they are not available in Zeus.

### List Buildings
- Use it to quickly find which buildings have little or no ZEI templates.
- VR World Only
- Creates rows of buildings having the chosen number of templates or less.
- Coloured arrows in front of the buildings will indicate the templates count (Red = Mil, Pink = Civ).

### Mark Positions
- Highlights all building positions in a building.
- Don't block these when creating a template!

### Save Building Scheme
- Saves a building in the ZEI template format, no need to run any code through the debug menu now.
- Pressing 'LookAround' (Default: ALT) will 'force save' the highlighted object so you can save objects that aren't buildings.

### Why ZEI Community Version when there is ZEI Continued
